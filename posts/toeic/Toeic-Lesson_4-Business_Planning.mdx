## Words in context

### What is a Business Plan?

- A business plan is a document descbring a company's business activities and how it plans to achieve its goals.
- The business plan's primary purpose is to improve the `entrepreneur`'s control over the business and to help him avoid common mistakes.

### The benefits of Business Plan
There is no substitute for a well-prepareed business plan. It is the way to `strengthen` the business and help it improve in all areas. The business plan documents the strategy for growing the business.

- Startup companies use business plans to `get off` the ground and attract outside `investors`.
- For established companies, a business plan can help keep the executive team focused on and working `toward` the company's short- and long-term objectives.

As a road map, the business plan determines which direction the company is going, what its goals are, and how it is going to get there.
### How to write Business Plan

- Focus the achievable goals based on short and long-term. For example, achieve 20% revenue growth in the current financial year.

- Research the company's target market and define its potential.

- Meet the needs of customers in the market: the good or service that is offered, which aspects of products are attractive to make customers support the business (convert the potential customer to the durable customer).

- Plan to reduce risks and manage them in available control, such as which policies and legal regulations you must `obligate`.

- Determines the organizational structure of the business and how it operates (evaluate the effectiveness of achievement, how to attract and train resource humans,...)

### Why Do Business Plans Fail?

A business plan is not a surefire recipe for success. The plan may have been unrealistic in its assumptions and projections to begin with. Markets and the overall economy might change in ways that couldn't have been `foreseen`. 

A competitor might introduce a `revolutionary` new product or service. All of this calls for building some flexibility into your plan, so you can pivot to a new course if needed.
