Dear Mr.Smith,

I am writing to **dispute** the **charges** on the invoice I recently received from your company. The invoice contained several mistakes.

*First,* I was told that I would receive a 30 percent discount when making a purchase at your branch in New York by June 7. I go ahead and buy a laptop before the discount expires. I should not pay a fee higher like this.

*Second,* the advertisement states that **accessories** include a **wired mouse** and **mousepad**. But I don't find these items you listed on the invoice, I feel confused about whether I can receive them. Hope you don't forget, please check it carefully.

*Finally,* it is easy to notice your mistake about the fee for extra warranty. I registered for one year but the reality is two years, thus double the charge. I think I can **expand** in the future, not the present.

I chose AVOV to get a standard laptop because several of my friends have been your satisfied customers. I find it difficult to believe that an **organizing business** can be so **inefficient** when it comes to invoices. Please **rectify** these mistakes and send me a accurate invoice **promptly**.

Sincerely,

Tri Hung
