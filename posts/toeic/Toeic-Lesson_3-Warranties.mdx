## Words in context

### What Is a Warranty?

A warranty is a guarantee or promise made by a manufacturer or similar party regarding the condition of their product. 
Buyers must fulfill specific duties for the warranty to be honored.

### How Warranties Work 

- **The warranty period**: The warranty are only available for a specified period. When that period ends, the releasing entity is no longer obligated to repair or replace a product previously covered, generally from one to few years based on the sort of product and manufacturer.

- **The warranty condition**: Warranty card is almost attached to the products, has the sufficient details about customer, product and brand name pulished from many professional printing location. It describes the essential conditions that the products are accepted for the repairs or replacements, such as product must be used as its intent, not deffective by the outside impact and not previously repaired from the unauthorized party.

- **Customer's interests**: Warranties can provide discounted repair and replacement services for your product, and the best warranties offer a range of plans depending on the coverage you want (free services or pay an extra fee for extended warranty). 

### Warranty Tips 

If you are making a purchase, you should consider the individual characteristics of a warranty, as not all warranties are the same.
In fact, there is a great variety among them. 
Check the warranty to see what repairs it covers and for what amount of time.
