## 1.3 The Network Core

### 1.3.1 Packet Switching

To send a messages from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets.

Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and packets switches. Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link.

**Store-and-Forward Transmission**

- The packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.
- The source begins to transmit at time 0, at time $\displaystyle\frac{L}{R}$ seconds, the entire packet (L-bit) has been received and stored at the router (it can begin to transmit the packet onto the outbound link towards the destination).
- At time 2 $\times$ $\displaystyle\frac{L}{R}$, the entire packet has been received by the destination.
(assuming zero propagation delay)

Let's now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to des-
tination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R (thus, there are N-1 routers
between source and destination). Applying the same logic as above, we see that the
end-to-end delay is:

> $d_{end-to-end}$ = N $\times$ $\displaystyle\frac{L}{R}$

**Queuing Delays and Packet Loss**

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an **output buffer** (also called an **output queue**), which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link.

![figure 1.12](/public/computer-networking/ch1/1.12.png)

if arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link
for a period of time:
- packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link.
- packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up.
